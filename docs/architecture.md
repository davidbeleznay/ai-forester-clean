# AI Forester App Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design and future development plans for the AI Forester App.

## Application Structure

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **Navigation System**
   - MainNavigator.js - Main navigation container
   - Tab-based navigation for primary screens
   - Stack navigation for nested screens

2. **Screens**
   - HomeScreen - Dashboard and app entry point
   - NewFormScreen - Form creation interface
   - SavedFormsScreen - List of saved forms
   - ViewFormScreen - Detailed form view

3. **Components**
   - Form Components (FormField, FormSection) - Reusable UI elements
   - Future planned components for specialized data collection

4. **Utilities**
   - formUtils.js - Form data management functions
   - Future planned utilities for data export, sync, etc.

5. **Configuration**
   - formConfig.js - Form template definitions
   - Future planned configurations for different assessment types

### Data Flow

1. **Form Creation**
   - User inputs data in NewFormScreen
   - Data validated and processed
   - Saved to AsyncStorage with unique ID

2. **Form Retrieval**
   - SavedFormsScreen loads all forms from AsyncStorage
   - Data displayed in a list format
   - User selects a form to view details

3. **Form Viewing**
   - ViewFormScreen loads specific form by ID
   - Renders form data in structured format
   - Provides options for management (delete, future: edit)

## Dynamic Form System

The dynamic form system is designed to be flexible and extensible:

### Form Field Types

The application supports multiple field types:
- Text inputs
- Number inputs
- Text areas
- Toggles/Boolean switches
- Future: Select/Dropdown menus
- Future: Multi-select options
- Future: Date pickers
- Future: Location/GPS data
- Future: Photo/media attachments

### Form Templates

Form templates are defined in `formConfig.js` and consist of:
- Sections that group related fields
- Field definitions with validation rules
- Default values and options

## Future Development Plans

### Short-term Goals

1. **Dynamic Form Builder**
   - Allow users to create custom form templates
   - Add support for all planned field types
   - Implement field validation system

2. **Data Export**
   - CSV export functionality
   - Email sharing options
   - PDF report generation

3. **Location Services**
   - GPS location capture
   - Map integration for location selection
   - Geofencing for assessment areas

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Offline-First Data Sync**
   - Background sync to cloud storage
   - Conflict resolution
   - Multi-device access

2. **Media Management**
   - Photo capture and attachment
   - Photo annotation
   - Gallery management

3. **User Authentication**
   - User accounts
   - Role-based permissions
   - Team collaboration features

### Long-term Goals

1. **AI-Assisted Data Collection**
   - Species identification from photos
   - Automated measurements from images
   - Predictive analysis

2. **Advanced Reporting**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Trend analysis
   - Comparative reporting

3. **Integration Ecosystem**
   - API for third-party integrations
   - Data export to forestry management systems
   - Integration with IoT sensors and devices

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading for form templates
- Pagination for large form lists
- Efficient AsyncStorage usage

### Security

- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure cloud sync (when implemented)
- Input validation and sanitization

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Responsive design for various device sizes
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Accessibility considerations

## Conclusion

The AI Forester App architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich application. By adhering to this architecture and following the outlined development plans, the application will evolve into a comprehensive tool for forestry professionals.
